Ideas for tests

Reponses:
    Machinery
        Hilbert paths
            Equality

    Linears:
        Lorentzian peak
        Gaussian peak
        HR coupling
        Test both rescaled and not (shape vs quantitative)
    Third order:
        two level system, purely homogeneous
        two level system, homo+inhomo, compare to sum of gaussian distribution of 2D Lorentzian

    Lineshape functions
        homogeneous (trivial)
        inhomogeneous (trivial)
        kubo (trivial)
        HR (trivial)
        spectral density integration... (when needed.)
